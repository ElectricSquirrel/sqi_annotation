# snr_annotation
Small interface in Matlab for annotating data acording to their SNR and presence of fetal signal.
Can be deployed by simpling compiling the project annotator.prj.

Shortcuts for annotation:
- Levels for noise: 1,2,3,4,5;
- Levels for fetal presence: a,s,d,f.

I tried to make it platform independent, neverthless it was designed using:
 - Matlab 2013a
 - Windows 7
